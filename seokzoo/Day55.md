Dear Laura Diamond,
  
I sended the email instead of call because everyone is busy. I changed the date for the regular meeting.  
-> Everyone is busy. so I **send** **an e-mail** instead of **calling**.   
The original date is May 4 but we have another event on the same date. Two are on the same date. We should have checked the month plan. That would have caused problems.  
-> The original date is **May 4th**. **The two occasions clashes**. We should have checked **the monthly schedule** **before**. It **could have caused** trouble.  
We should delay the meeting in my opinion. so I choose the date on May 10. I noticed the exact date and place via email. After noticing, I will call to everyone later.  
-> I think we **had better** delay the meeting, so I chose a different date, May 10th. In the e-mail, I informed the exact time and place. After the notification, I will **call everybody later**.  
Thank you for your support.  
-> Thank you for your cooperation.  
  
Sincerely,  
Hanil
