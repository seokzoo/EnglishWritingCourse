Dear Sonya,  
  
I hope you understand my situation. The weather was not good, so It was not arrived there on time. When I was not there, It was happend. I could do something.   
-> Please, understand my situation. The weather was not **all right**, so **it didn't arrive** there on time. **It happened** when I wasn't there.
Please, give me more time. If you give more time, I would change this situation. I will send the new thing now. If It is late again, I will hold the responsibility. If it is not enough, I will refund. When you receive it, if you have any problem, you can cancel our contract immediatley. If you don't help, I would get in big trouble.   
-> Please, **extend the time** **a little more**. If you extend the time, I can change this situation. I will **ship** the new **one** now. I will **take the full responsibility**. If it is not satisfactory, I will refund it. I will refund it. Upon receiving it, if you **see any problems**, you can cancel our contract immediately. I may **face huge difficulties**.
