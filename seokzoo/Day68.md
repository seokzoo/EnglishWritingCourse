How do cellular phones influence people's behavior?  
  
It is inevitable for people to use cellular phones nowadays. Most people spend a great deal of their time to use cellular phones. I think that there are two impacts of using cellular phones. Cellular phones are very useful.  
  
First, a celluar phone can help people to communicate with anyone in a long distance. For example, I have been doing a military service in Gaeryongdae. When I want to talk with my parents or friends, I just can call them using my cellular phone. If I don't have a cell phone, It is difficult to call anybody.  
  
Second, using a cellular phone can be a hobby. Modern cellular phones have various features. For instance, people can read books and play games on their phone. Many people use their phone in spare time.
  
To sum up, it seems to be impossible to live without cellular phones. Almost people have their own phone and spend a lot of time to use it. Because it has a lot of useful features, it is necessary for everybody to use a cellular phone. I see that the two huge impacts of the phone have totally changed people's behavior.
