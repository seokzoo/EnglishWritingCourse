Self-studying or group-studying?  
-> Studying alone or together?  
which one is better?  
-> **Which one do you think is better?**  
  
There are many ways of studying. I like to do with friends. There are two advantage. You can get informations and check I am doing.  
-> There are many studying types. I prefer to **be with my friends**. **I see two advantages;** I can **have informations and check what I am doing**   
  
First, If you study alone, you might have a few information. It would take the time and effort. Who can help me? My friends can help. For example, I know one historical event but, I don't know when it happend exactly. If my friend knows, we can exchange our knowledge.  
-> If I study alone, I may **face a lack of information**. I will take **much more** time and effort **for me to find the information I need**. My friends studying with me can **help with this problem**. I have **no idea** when it **did happen**. If my friend knows the date and year, we can share our information and **gain more solid knowledge**. This is a merit of cooperation.  
  
Second, I remember studying a wrong discipline one day because nobody tells me. If studying with friends, I could ask my friends. For example, If I omit some important parts, my friends could find my mistakes.  
-> I remember that I **once studied a wrong subject** and did a poor performance on my test. **It was because** no one told me that I was doing wrong. I can ask them to review my materials. When I miss some important elements during the preparation for the test, my friends **next to me** can easily **notice** my mistakes and correct me. By helping **one another** in this way, we can make a more reliable environment to study.  
  
As a result, It depends by people. but, I think there are two positive aspects in studying together seriously. My friends can give me informations I don't know and lead me.  
-> **In conclusion**, there are individual differences in learning style. However, I do see two positive sides of studying together. **That is**, my friends can provide information I do not have and guide me to the right direction.  
Therefore, I believe studying together is wise when I study.  
-> Therefore, I believe it is always wise for me to have someone with me who can **exchange help** when I study.
