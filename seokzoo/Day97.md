If a foreign tourist has only one day for spending your country, where should the tourist go?  
-> A foreign visitor has only one day **to spend** in your country. Where should this visitor go **on that day?**  
  
I suggest a traditional market to those having one day in Korean.  
-> **I would like to** suggest **visiting a local market** for those who have only one day to spend in Korea.  
  
First of all, each province sell different things. For example, I went to Hanoi in Vietnam. I chose to visit a traditional market. The traditional market which I found was a living museum. It was so great that I never forget it. Foreign tourists can have the same experiences.  
-> Different countries sell different **items**. **As an example**, I **once visited** Hanoi. **I decided** to visit a local market. The local market where I visited was **a live museum**. It was such a great experience that I will never forget. A foreign vistor can have the same experience.  
  
Secoundly, Tourists will hear some useful expressions when they go to the traditional market. Those who go to the market can get change to practice these expressions. For instance, I remember how to spaek "Thank you" in Vietnam yet. I heard that word when I buy. A market's atomosphere is so cheerful that I could learn the proper manner.  
-> Second, if foreign visitors visit a local market, they will hear some useful expressions. Visitors in the market can have a chance to practice these expressions. **As an illustration**, I **still** remember how to say "Thank you" in Vietnamese. No matter which I bought, I heard this. The atmosphere in the market was so vivid that I could learn the proper manner.  

In summary, it seems to be short for one day. But, If you choose a proper place, you can spend really nice time. The proper place is a traditional market. A traditional market will be vivid tour.
-> One day seemes to be too short. However, if you choose **the right one**, you can have a great time. The right place is a local market. The local market will be **the live tourist attraction**.
