Do you agree with following statement?  
-> Do you **agree or disagree** with the following statement?  
In a child education, Parents are more important than teachers.  
-> Parents are more important than teachers in **educating their children**.  
  
We rely on teachers and parents. But, Parents's role is still dominant. I believe because of two reasons. The reasons are that parents know how to handle their kids and they are willing to sacrifice for their kids.  
-> We depend **on both teachers and parents**. The role of parents **still dominates**. **Two reasons lead me to believe; parents know how to handle their children and they are willing to sacrifice themselves**.  
  
First, teachers are with childs only during a classtime. In other hands, childs spend the whole evening time with their parents. For example, On having a dinner, parents can tell how to do to their childs. These happenings are hard with teachers.  
-> **Firstly**, teachers only **stay with** the children during **the school hour**. **On the contrary**, children spend the evening time with their parents. **By having dinner together**, parents can tell to what to do to them. **This is unlikely happening with teachers**.  
  
Second, the difference between parents and teachers is that parents never ask to **pay back**. If there are no money, teachers would complain. But parents don't complain. They never tell, "You pay back as much as I give you".  
-> **Secondly**, the difference between parents and teachers is that parents never ask to pay back. If there is no **monetary consideration** to the teachers, they may complain. However, parents don't complain.They don't say, "You should **pay in return for what I have done."  
  
In conclusion, we have to list parents on first place. If all condition is the same, parents affect more directly to personality of childs because they share their own life. I believe that parents affect to their childs strongly.  
-> Conclusively speaking, we should put parents on the first list. **All things being equal**, parents can influence children's personality more directly because they share their life with their children.
